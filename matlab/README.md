# Matlab script for more productivity

There are several Matlab scripts in the folder:

(1). [read_pillar_bin.m](read_pillar_bin.m)

    the function to load the binary file into Matlab workspace. 

(2). [demo_force_map.m](demo_force_map.m)
    
    demo how to caluculate the force dependent on the deflections, and generate an interpolated force map.

(3). [demo_find_peak_deflection.m](demo_find_peak_deflection.m)   

    demo how to perform the peak analysis for the deflections. e.g. find the maximum peaks or peak width.

(4). [demo_subset_ROI.m](demo_subset_ROI.m)
    
    demo how to load partial pillars with region of interest(ROI) and compute the force.
